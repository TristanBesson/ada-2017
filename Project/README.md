# Colonisation and its impact on modern countries (Trouver un truc plus stylé)

## Abstract
_A 150 word description of the project idea, goals, dataset used. What story you would like to tell and why? What's the motivation behind your project?_

We will use the 'UCDP/PRIO Armed Conflict Dataset version 17.1' dataset from [here](http://ucdp.uu.se/downloads/), which covers armed conflict on the period from 1946 to 2016. From there, we want to record how the deconolization happened in post-european colonies to answer our problematic: How did the decolonisation affected the stability of the colonised country? 

We can first observe how did the deconolization took place, then observe the type of gouvernement that emerged (we could scrap informations from wikipedia to add informations). As the dataset looks at a large range of years, the stability of those gouvernements can also be visualized. 

At the end of the project, a data story will be created. Ideally, we would be able to observe on a map the different conflits linked to the decolonization. Adding interactivity to the map would let the user observe more informations, or just more precise with the conflict visualization on a smaller scale (cities and villages). The map could also evolve with the year we observe to add some dynamic to our story.


## Research questions
_A list of research questions you would like to address during the project._ 

- How did the decolonisation affected the stability of the colonised country?
- Can we observe some pattern for the future country stability depending on how the colonizer handled the conflict?
- ??? Peut-être quelque chose en lien avec les compétences qu'on apprendra?


## Dataset
_List the dataset(s) you want to use, and some ideas on how do you expect to get, manage, process and enrich it/them. Show us you've read the docs and some examples, and you've a clear idea on what to expect. Discuss data size and format if relevant._

**Dataset :** 'UCDP/PRIO Armed Conflict Dataset version 17.1' dataset from [here](http://ucdp.uu.se/downloads/)

UCDP defines conflict as: “a contested incompatibility that concerns government and/or territory where the use of armed force between two parties, of which at least one is the government of a state, results in at least 25 battle-related deaths in a calendar year.”

The dataset seems quite clean to work on. However to answer our problematic, we will need more informations to work on. For example, to understand what kind of gouvernment emerged we could look at the two actors of the conflict and follow the wikipedia page of the winning part of the conflict. If we follow the wikipedia page of the [FLN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Liberation_Front_(Algeria)) in Algeria, we can see who is at the head of the organization, see the years of activity of the movement, see what country they are affiliated with.

## A list of internal milestones up until project milestone 2
Add here a sketch of your planning for the next project milestone.

- Clean and arrange the datasets (UCDP + Other sources like Wikipedia) to be able to extract easily our desired information in our analysis.
- Exploratory Analysis. Is our project feasible? What unexpected informations can we extract from those first observations?
