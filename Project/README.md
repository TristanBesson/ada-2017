# Has the decolonisation set the countries free?

## Abstract

Different patterns appeared after the decolonisation. Some country like Morocco (french ex-colony) who had obtain his independence in a “relative” peace was and are note weakened by wars. On the contrary, Syria (also a french ex-colony) obtained its independence with difficulties, and since then, they have very important politics difficulties. The difference of stability between these two country can it be linked to the way they obtain their independence?

The problematic of this project is the next : How did the decolonization affected the stability of the colonised country ? To answer this questions, the 'UCDP/PRIO Armed Conflict Dataset version 17.1' dataset from [here](http://ucdp.uu.se/downloads/), which covers armed conflict on the period from 1946 to 2016 is used.

The aim of this project is to visualise, on an interactive map, the different conflicts linked to the decolonisation. A data story will be created to retrace what has been done during this project. 


## Research questions

- How did the decolonisation affected the stability of the colonised country?
- Can we observe some pattern for the future country stability depending on how the colonizer handled the conflict?
- How the decolonisation affected the type of government put in place after the decolonisation? 

## Dataset

**Dataset :** 'UCDP/PRIO Armed Conflict Dataset version 17.1' dataset from [here](http://ucdp.uu.se/downloads/)

The Dataset come from a joint project between the Uppsala Conflict Data Program (UCDP) and the Peace Research Institute in Oslo (PRIO). 
It contains information on armed conflict where at least one party is the government of a state in the time period 1946-2016.
UCDP defines conflict as: “a contested incompatibility that concerns government and/or territory where the use of armed force between two parties, of which at least one is the government of a state, results in at least 25 battle-related deaths in a calendar year.”
This Dataset will be used to extract all the information about the conflicts. But in order to interpret these information and answer the reasearch questions, more information are needed.
These will be extracted from Wikidata. Wikidata acts as central storage for the structured data of Wikipedia, Wikisource and others.

## A list of internal milestones up until project milestone 2
Add here a sketch of your planning for the next project milestone.

- Clean and arrange the datasets (UCDP + Other sources like Wikidata) to be able to extract easily our desired information in our analysis.
- Exploratory Analysis. Is our project feasible? What unexpected informations can we extract from those first observations
