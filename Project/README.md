# Has the decolonisation set the countries free?

## Abstract

Currently, lot of countries on war are ancient colony. Some country like Morocco (French ex-colony) who had obtain his independence in a “relative” peace was and are note weakened by wars. Conversely Syria (also a french ex-colony) obtain their independence in blood and they have very important politics difficulties since. Maybe there is a link between the way how colony obtain their independence and their political stability ? 

The problematic of our project is the next : How did the decolonization affected the stability of the colonised country ? To do that, we will use the 'UCDP/PRIO Armed Conflict Dataset version 17.1' dataset from [here](http://ucdp.uu.se/downloads/), which covers armed conflict on the period from 1946 to 2016.

The goal at the end of this project is to be able to visualise on an interactive map the different conflicts linked to the decolonisation. A data story will be created to retrace what has been done during this project. 


## Research questions

- How did the decolonisation affected the stability of the colonised country?
- Can we observe some pattern for the future country stability depending on how the colonizer handled the conflict?
- How the decolonisation affected the type of government put in place after the decolonisation? 

## Dataset

**Dataset :** 'UCDP/PRIO Armed Conflict Dataset version 17.1' dataset from [here](http://ucdp.uu.se/downloads/)

UCDP defines conflict as: “a contested incompatibility that concerns government and/or territory where the use of armed force between two parties, of which at least one is the government of a state, results in at least 25 battle-related deaths in a calendar year.”

The dataset seems quite clean to work on. However to answer our problematic, we will need more information. For example, to understand what kind of gouvernment emerged we could look at the two actors of the conflict and follow the wikidata page of the winning part of the conflict. If we follow the wikipedia page of the [FLN](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q204543) in Algeria, we can see who is at the head of the organization, see the years of activity of the movement, see what country they are affiliated with.

## A list of internal milestones up until project milestone 2
Add here a sketch of your planning for the next project milestone.

- Clean and arrange the datasets (UCDP + Other sources like Wikidata) to be able to extract easily our desired information in our analysis.
- Exploratory Analysis. Is our project feasible? What unexpected informations can we extract from those first observations
